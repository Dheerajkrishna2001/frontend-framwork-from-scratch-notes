Reconciliation algorithm

Compares new DOM and previous DOM.

Make the necessary changes, and attaches it to DOM.

This is called reconciliation algorithm.


Earlier we used to destroy the DOM completely, and mount it which is not effective.


Three Key functions of reconciliation algorithm.

1. Function to find the diff between two objects, returns keys added, removed, whose associated value changed.
2. find the diff between two arrays, returning items added, removed.
3. 

ObjectDiff() - returns keys removed, added and values changed for

ex: for attributes of an element.

arrayDiff() - returns the items added and removed.

ex: for class list array.

arrayDiffSequence()

ex: child nodes are removed and added all the times when user interacts with page.
